	<p>We have learned that an database management system is not unique to a industry, company, business owner, or sales
		agent. The Success using a database management system is determined by the daily use of predictable, repeatable,
		and simple actions. The financial reward for a business using an database is to save time, earn revenue, have
		control, provide better customer service, networking, refer/receive referrals, retain more clients, and much
		much more.
